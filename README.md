# Lab 5: Neural Word Embeddings

In thi lab, you'll be building your own n-gram model which you will use to generate text and to evaluate the probability of a text. This lab is due Friday, February 28, 11:59pm EST.

### Overview 
1. Clone the lab repo down to your own machine.
2. Complete the lab in the Colab notebook, as described below in Parts 1 and 2. 
3. Share your Colab notebook with me and the TAs, as described in the notebook.
4. Download, add, commit, and push your notebook to your repo. 


### Part 1: Getting your own copy of the Colab notebook.

[Here's a link to the Colab notebook for lab 5](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e6CTxc4Ka2ZfgYna6Gy4NBIesdL7Bd-1?usp=sharing). Remember you need to save a copy in your drive to start editing!


### Part 2: Complete the Colab notebook
* Follow the instructions in the [Colab notebook for Lab 5](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e6CTxc4Ka2ZfgYna6Gy4NBIesdL7Bd-1?usp=sharing) to create your own copy of the notebook.
* Edit the Colab notebook to complete the various tasks, as indicated in the notebook. Most of the time this will involve writing code in a code cell, but sometimes you will answer questions in a text cell. It will always be clear what you have to do.
* When your notebook is complete, you will share the notebook with me and the TAs, as decribed in the notebook.

### Part 3: Submit your work

* Download your Colab notebook to your computer, move it into this repository, and add, commit, and push it to GitHub, just like you did for prior labs.
* **Do not alter the Colab notebook after the deadline.** If you do -- even just to fix a typo! -- it will look like you turned the notebook in late. If you happen to do it, let the TAs know.
